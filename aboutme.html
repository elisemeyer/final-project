            <p>Hi I’m Elise, and I’m addicted to procrastinating, which is pretty ironic since I have a degree in event planning which requires you to be literally the opposite of a procrastinator, but alas, I have a problem. I should note that I do always get things done, but to put things in perspective, I packed for my study abroad semester the morning before I left and you don’t do that, YOU JUST DON’T! However, my procrastinating ways are in the past now. I’ve started this blog because I am turning a new leaf. I have postponed one too many dreams and it is time I start living! I know there have to be others like me out there and I’m hoping my journey will inspire them to stop putting their lives on hold because they are too afraid or lazy to get out today and do something! So here it goes! I hope you all enjoy watching me attempt to live a non-procrastinating life and make it look artsy and try to write posts even though I’ve only ever written like one story in my life when I was maybe seven and it just sat in the back seat of a car for years because that's how inspiring and creative it was. It’s going to be great, I promise. And if I fail, at least it’ll be entertaining to look back on! Oh and fun fact… I got the name for this blog from my lovely friends that used to randomly starting shouting "woe" when I was taking forever to get ready... woe, W.O.E., waiting on Elise. Love them.
